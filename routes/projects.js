          "Whilst at CashFlows I worked on a product called Payr Reloaded, a Visa prepaid wallet. We built the front-end in React/ JavaScript, SASS and Webpack. When I started with CashFlows some early development had already taken place on the project, but the site wasnâ€™t responsive and only worked in Chrome. I took the site from here to a fully responsive SPA (Single Page Application). I introduced a test framework using Jest and Enzyme, added linting for the SASS and JavaScript, refactored and optimised the code and introduced new features. We worked in an agile manner managing our stories and tasks through Jira. Our Sprints worked in three-week cycles with sizing sessions, breakdown sessions and retrospectives.",
